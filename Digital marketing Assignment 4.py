# Question 1.What's the difference between a landing page and a website?
# 
# Ans: Unlike a landing page, a website can have multiple pages of information with different goals and purposes.
# 
# Not each page on a website is as highly focused on conversions as a landing page.
# 
# For instance, a business website may want users to get information about all the products and
# services they are offering.
# It may also give users multiple calls to action to choose from (e.g. make a purchase, 
# ask for quote, join email list, follow on social media, and more).
# 
# Different types of websites would have different goals and a website gives them more ways to engage the audience.
# 
# A website could also be supported by multiple landing pages for their marketing campaigns.
# 
# For instance, a membership website may utilize a landing page for a subscription plan or an eCommerce store may
# want to create a pre-launch landing page for an upcoming product.
