# Question 1. In traditional marketing, what is cost analysis?
# 
# Ans:If you take a look at the marketing trends over the past 50 years,
# you will be able to see a similarity. They all revolve around Audio,
# Written word, and visual. From the traditional side, it is Radio, Newspaper,
# and TV ads. From a Digital side, it is Podcasts, Blogs, and social media verticals.
#   Back when the radio first became a popular marketing vertical advertising was very cheap, as was television, and newspaper ads. After years of people seeing the 
# benefit of these ads, the market became saturation the ads became more and more expensive.
# I can see this same trend with Social Media Ads, and it is terrifying. Since 2018,
# the price of Facebook ads has increased by 4x to reach 1,000 people! This will continue to
# happen until the market is so saturated the average joe business owner will NOT be able to
# afford a Facebook ad. 
# The good this is that digital marketing is WAY cheaper and more effective than Traditional Methods.

# Queestion 2.What is Digital Marketing Cost Analysis?
# 
# Ans: Digital marketing has helped to bring down marketing costs
# for some businesses, but it’s still important to understand if 
# the marketing money being spent is bringing in new leads towards 
# generating revenue for your business. One way to do that is to 
# perform a cost-effectiveness analysis – not only does this help
# to measure your reach, but it helps you to understand if your money
# are being spent wisely and effectively.
# 
# Measuring against goals
# 
# The first step to understanding the cost effectiveness ratio of your digital marketing efforts is to understand what the goals of your marketing are.
# 
# Understanding not all cost is monetary
# 
# While most people performing a cost-effectiveness analysis of their digital marketing efforts might simply try to understand campaign bottom-line dollars spent per impression, other businesses understand that the time it takes to brainstorm campaign concepts, create content, design digital advertising all have an inherent “cost” in the form of time or salary. The cost of marketing is beyond the money paid to a publisher to promote a piece or host an ad – don’t forget to factor in the “hidden” costs of creating digital marketing content.

# Question 3. What are the four p's of marketing?

# marketing objectives.
